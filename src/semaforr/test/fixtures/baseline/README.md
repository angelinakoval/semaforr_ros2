# SemaFORR behavioral baseline

This directory captures observable behavior before the SemaFORR refactor.
It contains two complementary baselines:

1. `source_contract.json` records behavior that can be characterized without
   starting ROS: topics, velocity conversion, action completion thresholds,
   default action magnitudes, feature flags, and tutorial targets.
2. A runtime trace records `cmd_vel` transitions and structured
   `decision_records` messages
   while a deterministic virtual robot publishes pose and open-space laser
   observations. Robot motion advances in fixed 50 ms simulation steps; it
   does not integrate wall-clock timer jitter.

The source contract is verified by `test_source_contract.py`. It is deliberately
strict: if a refactor changes a value, the test should fail until the change is
reviewed and the contract is intentionally updated.

## Capture the runtime golden trace

Build and source the workspace in ROS 2 Humble:

```bash
src/semaforr/scripts/run_quality_checks.sh normal
source install/setup.bash
mkdir -p baseline-results
ros2 launch semaforr stage_tutorial_baseline.launch.py \
  output:="$(pwd)/baseline-results/stage_tutorial.actual.json"
```

Inspect the complete trace before approving it. Once accepted, copy it to:

```text
src/semaforr/test/fixtures/baseline/stage_tutorial.expected.json
```

Do not approve a trace merely because the process exited successfully. Review
the action sequence, decision diagnostics, final pose, ROS warnings, and known
issues first. Capture the same revision at least twice and compare both traces
before replacing the approved semantic baseline.

## Compare a later run

```bash
python3 src/semaforr/scripts/compare_decision_traces.py \
  src/semaforr/test/fixtures/baseline/stage_tutorial.expected.json \
  baseline-results/stage_tutorial.actual.json \
  src/semaforr/test/fixtures/regression/stage_tutorial.classifications.json
```

Timestamps, detailed advisor comments, measured computation times, and the
final floating-point pose are not compared. Action, tier, and planner changes
must either match exactly or have a reviewed intentional-improvement
classification with a rationale. Unclassified changes and regressions fail the
command. The complete actual trace retains volatile details for inspection and
performance comparison.

## Profiles

```bash
src/semaforr/scripts/run_quality_checks.sh normal
src/semaforr/scripts/run_quality_checks.sh sanitizer
src/semaforr/scripts/run_quality_checks.sh coverage
```

The sanitizer profile enables AddressSanitizer, UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, and
leak detection. The coverage profile instruments the package and creates an
HTML report when `lcov` and `genhtml` are installed.

## Captured environment status

The approved trace was captured and repeated in the repository's ROS 2 Humble
container. Schema version 2 records every input pose, the exact repeated laser
fixture, velocity transitions, action and task transitions, tier/veto/advisor
diagnostics, planner diagnostics, and performance measurements.
