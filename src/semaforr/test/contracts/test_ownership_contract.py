"""SemaFORR module overview.

Summary:
    This file exercises test ownership contract behavior for automated verification and regression testing. It centers on `production_code`, `test_no_explicit_heap_allocation_or_raw_owning_delete`, `test_polymorphic_owners_use_unique_ptr_and_virtual_destructors`, `test_shared_ptr_is_limited_to_snapshot_infrastructure_and_ros_adapters`. Its package-relative location is `test/contracts/test_ownership_contract.py`.

Arguments:
    Not applicable at module scope.

Returns:
    Not applicable at module scope.

Raises:
    Import-time dependency errors may propagate.
