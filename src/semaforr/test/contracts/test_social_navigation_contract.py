"""SemaFORR module overview.

Summary:
    This file exercises test social navigation contract behavior for automated verification and regression testing. It centers on `read`, `test_upstream_social_messages_are_adapted_at_the_ros_boundary`, `test_crowd_model_unifies_live_and_learned_social_state`, `test_advisors_and_planners_consume_domain_crowd_model`, `test_stale_social_data_has_explicit_fallback`, `test_structured_social_modes_validate_only_selected_dependencies`, `test_crowd_visualization_is_direct_and_ros_transport_is_absent`, `test_decisions_plans_replay_and_why_share_social_diagnostics`. Its package-relative location is `test/contracts/test_social_navigation_contract.py`.

Arguments:
    Not applicable at module scope.

Returns:
    Not applicable at module scope.

Raises:
    Import-time dependency errors may propagate.
